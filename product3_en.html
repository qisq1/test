Today, in the 21st century, the Belt and Road has given her more vitality. Xinjiang is one of the main production areas of cashmere in China, and the cashmere industry will receive unprecedented development. Compared with cashmere in Inner Mongolia and other places, cashmere fibers in Xinjiang are more delicate and shorter, and cashmere fibers in Inner Mongolia and other places are thicker and longer, but the thermal effect is similar. The cashmere sweater, cashmere quilt, cashmere shawl and other products produced by Xinjiang cashmere have the characteristics of light, thin and soft, and are relatively more comfortable. </p>
